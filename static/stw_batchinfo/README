Experimental app with Sencha Touch 2 integrated with SAP using BSP. Application flow:

- reads a barcode (needs a phonegap client with the barcode plugin installed)
- call SAP to get the batch information
- displays the batch information
  - if the batch is blocked displays a button to unblock
  - if the batch is unblocked displays a button to block
- if a button is pressed the action (block/unblock) is called in SAP and the information refreshed
